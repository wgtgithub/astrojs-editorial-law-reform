# 🚀 Editorial for Astro

**A ready-to-deploy LP template built with Astro.js, designed for civic initiatives and social reform advocacy.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This template was originally created as part of a tax system reform campaign in Japan.
The initial crowdfunding attempt via Readyfor failed to gain traction, prompting a strategic pivot:

* Moved to self-hosted PayPal-based fundraising
* Built a landing page from scratch using Astro.js
* Developed a reusable, static-site-compatible template to communicate legislative proposals effectively

This template is the result of that process—battle-tested, streamlined, and optimized for non-technical reformers who need to get their message out fast.

---

## 🛠 Features

* ✅ Astro.js v4.x ready
* ✅ Drop-in support for HTML5 UP templates (converted to Astro)
* ✅ `public/`-based static assets with `is:inline` compatibility
* ✅ Clean layout structure using `slot` and `Astro.props`
* ✅ Easy build + preview with production fidelity

Original description:

> Editorial is a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking" sidebar and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!) template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
